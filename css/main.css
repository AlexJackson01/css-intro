/* ## Objectives
- Link the `index.html` and `main.css` files together
- Target an element and change its colour.
- Pick a heading tag and change its font size, make it bold and underlined.
- Import a font from Google fonts, link it to your HTML page and try to use it for one of your lists (ordered/unordered)
- Create two `<div>` sections. Style each of them with different background colours/fonts/different border styles. Try experimenting with the padding and margins to see how you can position content within each div. *Hint:  Use different class names for each div*

## Flexbox Bonus!
- Add the pictures in the `images` folder to your page
- Make it so the pictures are displayed in a row and centred on screen
- Feel free to play around with more Flexbox properties to position your images */
